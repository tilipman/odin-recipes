    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Egg</li>
      <li>Portobelo bacon (mushrooms)</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>Breakfast potatoes</li>
      <li>Black beans</li>
      <li>Tortillas</li>
      <li>red onions</li>
      <li>avocado</li>
      <li>cream sauce</li>
      <li>cheese</li>
      <li>hot sauce/halapegno</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Cook the crumbled tofu or vegan egg over medium heat. When almost done,
        add the bacon and mix in. Put into a bowl and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you want the cabbage wilted a little, add to the pan and saute with
        broth or oil until just wilted. You can also use it cold, but this is a
        good option too.
      </li>
      <li>
        Warm the tortillas by wrapping them in a damp paper towel and heating in
        the microwave for 30-45 seconds. Keep heating in 15 second increments to
        get them soft and pliable.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fill with ingredients of choice, we used Â¼ cup of the egg mixture,
        potatoes and beans. Then topped with all the fixings.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fold in the sides, then bring the bottom over the top of the ingredients
        and tuck around them tight as you roll the burrito closed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place seam side down on a heated pan over medium low and grill for about
        3-5 minutes until the edge is sealed. This helps make eating the burrito
        easier so it doesnt fall apart, and also gives some great texture.
      </li>
      <li>Enjoy!</li>
